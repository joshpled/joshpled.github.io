 I've sat in front of my laptop for about an hour trying to think about how to start this. It's not that I don't know, it's that the answer isn't simple. I didn't wake up one day, frustrated with my job, wanting a change. This has been a long time coming. 

I think deep down, I wanted to be in the tech industry. Everyone in my family thought I was going to go to college for IT. Everyone wanted me to. I think that all the pressure made me feel like I would be taking the easy way out. I wanted to be an artist, or something. I don't know. I think I was just afraid of doing what everyone else was doing. 

I went to film school, moved to New Orleans, and tried to make it big. To my surprise... I hated it all.

Since the time I was 5, playing video games on a computer with these huge floppy disks. To the time after New Orleans, when I started my own photo studio. I've always been hooked on computers. Building them, buying them, finding new ways to use them, cellphones, and... well you get the idea. 

So 4 years ago, when I decided to go back to school, I kept doing my research. I didn't want to make the same mistake twice. I started online with Lynda.com. Realized this might be something I want to do. I started at a community college to start with some classes and eventually got wind of this bootcamp idea. It's been a wonderful journey of self-discovery and I'm just ready to do something drastic to change my life and move on with being satisfied with what I do every day. 

Now's my chance!
