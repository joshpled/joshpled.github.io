The OO Triangle Lab was a fascinating adventure into refactoring that I think you'll benefit from hearing. 

While I wish I could take credit for this, however I was lucky enough to find a tutorial for this.

It is my personal opinion that refactoring is a skill as important as knowing how to write the code in the first place. With this particular lab, the challenge was creating an IF loop that would take in any set of 3 numbers and compare them to one another and determine what type of triangle was being inputted. After running the tests I realized it's not as easy as coding every type of triangle. They add the additional challenge of triangles with no size or negative sizes.
