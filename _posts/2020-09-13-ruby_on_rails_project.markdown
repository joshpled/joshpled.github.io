**TAMAGAPURI!**

In the late 90s, Bandai released to the world the "Tamagotchi!" It was AWESOME! I was only 7 years old, but they were wildly popular, many iterations came after, and by the early 2000s, I got to play with one! I was hooked. I still love the concept of a virtual pet to take care of. Probably because I don't trust myself with a real pet. Especially after I heard a weird sound coming from my Tamagotchi and saw my frog like creature in angel wings to signify that I had in fact killed my pet. It was... traumatizing. 

This is the inspiration behind Tamagapuri! According to wikipedia, Tamagotchi, "the name is a portmanteau combining the two Japanese words tamago (たまご), which means "egg", and uotchi (ウオッチ) "watch".

Well since my project isn't on a handheld device, or at least not a watch, I created my own portmanteau of Tamago and Apuri (アプリ) which means "App"! 

The concept is quiet simple:

You have a pet. It has 4 main attributes: health, hunger, boredom, and happiness is an average of the first three.

Here's the homepage:

You can create monsters, go to the store, or gamble!

You have two goals: Keep your monsters alive and don't run out of money!

When you gamble you can win BIG or lose by a lot.

When you shop you can get 4 different categories of items.

Buy items, keep your monsters alive, and that's where the fun is! 

# CHALLENGES
I heard a story once: a dad is teaching his son to code and he heard his son exclame from his room "YES! I DID IT!"
He told his son "That feeling of accomplishment will never go away." 
Later he hears his son exclame "NO! WHAT IS WRONG!? WHAT DID I BREAK!?" 
He told his son "That feeling will also never go away."

It spoke to me. 

**The Devise Gem**

Thankful to my cohort lead for showing us how to set it up! There are some challenges though. After a while of googling I did find the solution to adding an extension to validate strong passwords.

Devise and the extensions are a great gem to make sessions, validations, user signup, and login a simple process. 

**Bootstrap**

I have developed a love hate relationship with Bootstrap. It's a CSS issue and not understanding the frontend as much as I wish I did. Which lead me to a great appreciation once again for frontend development. I will be focusing more on how to work with frontend. 

**DRY Code**

Refactoring and to make the code more DRY is a challenge I enjoy everytime I take it on. My favorite was figuring out the slot machines. I wanted it to be able to accept a bid and determine an award. I learned alot from previous classes. I have learned that "case when" statements are my personal favorite for this kind of thing. 

#  Final Thoughts
I know this is the most exciting blog post you've ever read, but I'm not a writer. I'm a coder. I have learned one extremely important thing in all of this... I love to code! Its an exciting moment to google and google and read and then find out how to make what you want happen and a small moment of "I'm a genius!" I love that rush.
