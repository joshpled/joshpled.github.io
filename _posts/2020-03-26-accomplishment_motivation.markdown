Throughout this journey so far, I've felt a wonderful sense of accomplishment when I find the solution to something on my own. I love that feeling that is easily described as that "HELL YEA!" moment. It's great. 

Hard truth, it's not motivational. It's a small high that I hold on to. It's the reason I keep going but not the reason I dedicate my life to it. 

Motivation is a funny mechanic the brain desperately wants to make things worth doing. It's not that easy. What's your why? If you're not sure how to answer that, then you won't want to do this because you have no purpose for it. 

Motivation isn't something you pick up arbitrarily and it isn't sustainable.

I could have the worst day, and I will still get on the laptop and do work. Why? I'm doing this for something bigger than my day. I'm doing this for my future. I'm doing this so in a few years, hopefully less, I can say "I'm so proud of myself." 

I'm doing this for future me. The me that looks back and is thankful that all my hard work paid off and I'm finally who I want to be. This isn't my only goal right now and working on myself is all the "moitivation" I need.
